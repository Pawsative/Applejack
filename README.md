# Important:
You will need a MySQL database, and MySQLOO V8.

You can get MySQLOO from here:
http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1220537

#Setup:
Make sure the folder name is applejack, not applejack-master, and put the folder into /gamemodes/ in your gmod directory.
Edit the sh_config.lua and sv_config.lua to your liking.

----------------------------------------------------
You can either do this:

Import the .sql file into your database, & make sure you have MySQLOO in your garrysmod/lua/bin folder. (If you don't have it, just make it).

Or:

Add the gamemode to your server, start the server & then restart it so it can make the tables.
----------------------------------------------------

(You'll also need libmysql, you can get that from the same place as MySQLOO)

#Extra:
You will need evolve or exsto (for now) for this gamemode to work properly, and I'll be activly working on this.
