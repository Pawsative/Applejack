# Applejack

Applejack is an old 'CityRP' gamemode, based on Cider that was made by kurozael and edited by Lexi.

If you're wanting to start a 'CityRP' server, you probably should just make your own gamemode instead of editing a 7 year old gamemode.
# Credits
kurozael (Conna) - Made the core systems of Cider, populated it with items and released it.

Lexi - Vast swathes of improvements to the script, going with the philosophy that "Light RP doesn't have to be shit."

FPTje - His MySQLite module

Pawsative - Conversion of the gamemode

rayts - Conversion of the gamemode

Int64 - Conversion of the gamemode

# Installation

This gamemode is using FPTje's MySQLite module, so you can just install the gamemode like normal & use it, if you want to use MySQL edit sv_config.lua, I have made it alot easier for you to use this gamemode because it was already too hard!

# Support:
I'm no longer supporting this gamemode, if you need help use https://gmodstore.com or make your own gamemode, as this one is terribly made and very un-optimized. It was converted when I was new to Lua, and is not a showcase of my Lua knowledge.
